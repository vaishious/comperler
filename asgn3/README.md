## README

* No building necessary as it is a python project.

* Simply run `./bin/parser ./test/test*.pl`

* If the input file contains syntax errors, no output html file is generated.

* The file test/test9_buggy.pl is a test case containing syntax errors that has been included to demonstrate the error recovery mechanism of our parser.
